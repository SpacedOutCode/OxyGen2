  ## What is OxyGen2?

OxyGen2 is a mockup of google chromes inspect element feature in bookmarklet form.

## Why was it made?

It was made because my school (and many others) blocked us from using inspect element on our chromebooks. O² was created to give us that freedom back, allowing us to bypass the schools censorship.

## Features

- Console
- Tools tab with school cheats built in
- ELement editing
- Inspect element

## To-Add

- themes
- colored and properly formatted elements tab
- css redo of all tabs (in progress)
